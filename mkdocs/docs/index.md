# Introduction

Flax is a language that extends YAML syntax to enhance configuration files. It is implemented as a small Clojure library.

## Highlights

Flax is YAML enhanced with Clojure. YAML is already a really powerful tool for creating "human friendly," yet machine readable, data serializations. Clojure is one of the best designed functional languages out there. One of the benefits of using functional expressions is that at the end of the day, they represent data. So this is something that YAML and Clojure share in common. Using them together lets you tell a story about the data you create.

In addition to interoperability with Clojure, Flax gives you access to the environment generally, so that you can easily interpolated all kinds of values into your configuration files.

Here's a quick example of how it works.
